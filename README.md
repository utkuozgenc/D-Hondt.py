# D-Hondt.py
This Python programme calculates how many seats each party will get according to the given inputs.

# ABOUT INPUTS

You need to enter the party names that is going to take place in the election. Election is supposed to be country-wide; therefore, vote ratio of the party will be asked in order to calculate, whether the party is above the barrage or not.
Disclaimer: It has been assumed that ratio input will be given as the same order as party names. Furthermore, each party name and each ratio value should have splitted with a comma (,).
Then the programme will ask for the alliances if any.
